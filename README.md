Official Repository for Animonculory Modlists

## [Animonculory Visual Overhaul](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/Animonculory-Visual-Overhaul/blob/main/Readme.md)
Animonculory Visual Overhaul (AVO) is designed as a base for your own modlist. Featuring graphical enhancements, mandatory bug fixes and tweaks and method patching, it is the perfect base to build upon. AVO is made for Skyrim Special Edition Version 1.6.353 (also known as Anniversary Edition) and uses the .exe of that version as well.

## [Septimus](https://github.com/Guitarninja2/septimus/blob/main/README.md)
> "I can almost... hear them. I feel their life energy. Come, I will make the mixture."

Septimus is an extensive modlist full of carefully chosen new gear, spells, quests, and personal touches, all designed to fit seamlessly into the game. It also contains optional lightweight survival gameplay and full anniversary edition creation club support. It is designed to look beautiful while maintaining a stable 60+ framerate on almost any machine.

## [Tinvaak](https://github.com/Althro/Tinvaak2/blob/main/README.md)
> "The Dragonborn may very well save the day, but to this uncaring realm, you are just a mortal. You are yet another unimportant person in the world, something that passersby see and rarely interact with. As you advance, weapons drawn, you hesitate, unsure if you can really do this. That tiny bit of uncertainty, that small voice of doubt: It's amplified and ever-present."

Tinvaak is a list focused on making Skyrim: Special Edition (SSE) into an actual roleplaying game. Many new mechanics and changes are present to offer an alternate take on the game. You can view many of these changes in the [showcase video from DroppedIceCream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N0cOrv5Crc), the [official trailer](https://youtu.be/8bLSGfok47g) and the [Beginners guide](https://github.com/Althro/Tinvaak2/blob/main/Beginners%20Guide%20to%20Tinvaak.md).

## [Ruvaak](https://github.com/chri3i/Ruvaak-Readme/blob/main/README.md)
> "You are not alone. Remember this the next time you wander the harsh, frozen lands of Skyrim. Many have tried --and failed-- to discover what lurks out there, in the mists, and many will after you are gone. Tell me, do you have what it takes to survive?"

Ruvaak is a list focused on making Skyrim: Anniversary Edition (AE) into a dark fantasy roleplaying game. Many new mechanics and changes are present to offer an alternate take on the game. You can view many of these changes [showcase video from DroppedIceCream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY1qEnkNpzM) and in the [Changes to Gameplay](https://github.com/chri3i/Ruvaak-Readme/blob/main/changes%20to%20gameplay.md) article. 

## [Journey](https://github.com/SiraMirai/journey/blob/main/README.md)
> "You realize that all your life you have been coasting along as if you were in a dream. Suddenly, facing the trials of the last few days, you have come alive."

Journey is a simple modlist designed to give a vanilla-like graphical presentation and provide a solid Vanilla+ gameplay overhaul with full Creation Club integration. Journey's purpose is to provide a base graphical and gameplay overhaul to play Skyrim fairly close to how the game was or to add on your own choice of followers, quests, and new lands beyond what is already included.
