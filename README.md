Have you ever launched Skyrim and wished you could play as any other character except the Dragonborn of Legend? Do you appreciate friendly survival mechanics, classic RPG elements, and discovering the strengths and weaknesses of opponents to better tackle the new challenges they present? Are you a fan of playing as a Khajiit?

If you answered "yes" to any of the above, then Krahven might be the list for you.

## [Ruvaak](https://github.com/chri3i/Ruvaak-Readme/blob/main/README.md)
> "You are not alone. Remember this the next time you wander the harsh, frozen lands of Skyrim. Many have tried --and failed-- to discover what lurks out there, in the mists, and many will after you are gone. Tell me, do you have what it takes to survive?"

Ruvaak is a list focused on making Skyrim: Anniversary Edition (AE) into a dark fantasy roleplaying game. Many new mechanics and changes are present to offer an alternate take on the game. You can view many of these changes [showcase video from DroppedIceCream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY1qEnkNpzM) and in the [Changes to Gameplay](https://github.com/chri3i/Ruvaak-Readme/blob/main/changes%20to%20gameplay.md) article.
