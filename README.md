# Animonculory Modlists
Official Repository for Animonculory Modlists

## [Animonculory Visual Overhaul](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/Animonculory-Visual-Overhaul/blob/main/Readme.md)
Animonculory Visual Overhaul (AVO) is designed as a base for your own modlist. Featuring graphical enhancements, mandatory bug fixes and tweaks and method patching, it is the perfect base to build upon. AVO is made for Skyrim Special Edition Version 1.6.353 (also known as Anniversary Edition) and uses the .exe of that version as well.

## [Septimus](https://github.com/Guitarninja2/septimus/blob/main/README.md)
> "I can almost... hear them. I feel their life energy. Come, I will make the mixture."
Septimus is an extensive modlist full of carefully chosen new gear, spells, quests, and personal touches, all designed to fit seamlessly into the game. It also contains optional lightweight survival gameplay and full anniversary edition creation club support. It is designed to look beautiful while maintaining a stable 60+ framerate on almost any machine.

## [Tinvaak](https://github.com/Althro/Tinvaak2/blob/main/README.md)
> "The Dragonborn may very well save the day, but to this uncaring realm, you are just a mortal. You are yet another unimportant person in the world, something that passersby see and rarely interact with. As you advance, weapons drawn, you hesitate, unsure if you can really do this. That tiny bit of uncertainty, that small voice of doubt: It's amplified and ever-present."

Tinvaak is a list focused on making Skyrim: Special Edition (SSE) into an actual roleplaying game. Many new mechanics and changes are present to offer an alternate take on the game. You can view many of these changes in the [showcase video from DroppedIceCream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N0cOrv5Crc), the [official trailer](https://youtu.be/8bLSGfok47g) and the [Beginners guide](https://github.com/Althro/Tinvaak2/blob/main/Beginners%20Guide%20to%20Tinvaak.md).
