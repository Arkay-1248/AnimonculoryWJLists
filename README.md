## [Krahven](https://sites.google.com/view/krahven/krahven-main-page)
Have you ever launched Skyrim and wished you could play as any other character except the Dragonborn of Legend? Do you appreciate friendly survival mechanics, classic RPG elements, and discovering the strengths and weaknesses of opponents to better tackle the new challenges they present? Are you a fan of playing as a Khajiit?

If you answered "yes" to any of the above, then Krahven might be the list for you.

> "You are not alone. Remember this the next time you wander the harsh, frozen lands of Skyrim. Many have tried --and failed-- to discover what lurks out there, in the mists, and many will after you are gone. Tell me, do you have what it takes to survive?"

## [Tinvaak](https://github.com/Althro/Tinvaak2/blob/main/README.md)
> "The Dragonborn may very well save the day, but to this uncaring realm, you are just a mortal. You are yet another unimportant person in the world, something that passersby see and rarely interact with. As you advance, weapons drawn, you hesitate, unsure if you can really do this. That tiny bit of uncertainty, that small voice of doubt: It's amplified and ever-present."

Tinvaak is a list focused on making Skyrim: Special Edition (SSE) into an actual roleplaying game. Many new mechanics and changes are present to offer an alternate take on the game. You can view many of these changes in the [showcase video from DroppedIceCream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N0cOrv5Crc), the [official trailer](https://youtu.be/8bLSGfok47g) and the [Beginners guide](https://github.com/Althro/Tinvaak2/blob/main/Beginners%20Guide%20to%20Tinvaak.md).
